# The next block is the documentation associated with our function. It is

"""
    scale_it(f::Function,x::Real,c::Real) -> Real

Takes as input a function `f` and two real-valued arguments `x` and `c` and returns
value `c*f(x)`.

For example,
```
julia> g(x) = x^2

julia> HW1.scale_it(g,1,2)
2
```

"""
    trisolve(a,b,c,f::Vector{<:Real},sys_type::String) -> Vector{Real}

Solve a tridiagonal system, in which the matrix consists of elements `a`, `b`, and `c`,
on the subdiagonal, diagonal, and superdiagonal, respectively, and the right-hand
side of the system is given by vector `f`. The `sys_type` of system can be either `"circulant"`
or `"regular"`. The solution is returned as a vector the same size as `f`.

For `"circulant"` systems, `a`, `b` and `c` can only be scalars, since the diagonals
must each be uniform. For `"regular"` systems, these can each be vectors, but `b` must
be the same length as `f` and `a` and `c` should be one element shorter.
